fitness_criterion     = max 
determines how the best dinosaurs are selected: since we want dinosaurs
with highest fitness to be selected we set this to max

fitness_threshold     = 10000
evolution process is terminated when fitness_threshold is reached

pop_size              = 15
no of dinos in every generation

reset_on_extinction   = False
If this evaluates to True, when all dinos simultaneously become 
extinct due to stagnation, a new random population will be created
